      'Smart Thinking: Skills for Critical Understanding and Writing 2E is a practical step-by-step guide to improving skills in analysis, critical thinking, and the effective communication of arguments and explanations. The book combines an accessible and straightforward style, with a strong foundation of knowledge. The text treats reasoning as an aspect of communication, not an abstract exercise in logic. The book not only provides detailed advice on how to practise analytical skills, but also demonstrates how these skills can be used in research and writing. In particular, it emphasises how to develop arguments that are coherent and that take account of their audience and context.',

    description:
      'Coding Theory: Algorithms, Architectures and Applications provides a concise overview of channel coding theory and practice, as well as the accompanying signal processing architectures. The book is unique in presenting algorithms, architectures, and applications of coding theory in a unified framework. It covers the basics of coding theory before moving on to discuss algebraic linear block and cyclic codes, turbo codes and low density parity check codes and space-time codes. Coding Theory provides algorithms and architectures used for implementing coding and decoding strategies as well as coding schemes used in practice especially in communication systems.',

    image: '/images/DataScience.jpg',
    description:
      "Data science libraries, frameworks, modules, and toolkits are great for doing data science, but they're also a good way to dive into the discipline without actually understanding data science. With this updated second edition, you'll learn how many of the most fundamental data science tools and algorithms work by implementing them from scratch. If you have an aptitude for mathematics and some programming skills, author Joel Grus will help you get comfortable with the math and statistics at the core of data science, and with hacking skills you need to get started as a data scientist. Today's messy glut of data holds answers to questions no one's even thought to ask. This book provides you with the know-how to dig those answers out.",
